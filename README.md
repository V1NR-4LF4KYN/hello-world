# hello-world
my first repository on GitHub
Some INFO about me: I've started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Now I am learning Python. I also used Windows the whole time. But I've decided to install a dual-boot system with Kali Linux and Windows. So now I am learning Python, the Linux Shell and I've registered at GitHub. Isn't that great :D.
